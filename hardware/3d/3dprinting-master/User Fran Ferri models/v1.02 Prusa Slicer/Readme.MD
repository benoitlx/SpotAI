## Information

Files created with Prusa Slicer 2.1.1
Tested with Prusa MK3S printer

I've adjusted supports to ensure perfect printing for all pieces.

One note about the foot, I've modified the 1.02 file and created a neutral one. You can print it 4 times and will fit everywhere. Also reduced perimeters so, you can glue it with thermal glue, it fits very easy and is not loose.

TPU is basically rubber, you can adjust the legs shoes infill to have more grip. 100% infill will not have a lot of grip since will become a solid piece, but 10% will be soft and will behave better.
