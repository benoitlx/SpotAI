# Folders

This branch from version 1.0 of the SpotMicro contains the following changes:

* I changed the nuts and bolts to self tapping screws (way easier and faster to assemble and open/close covers to access electronics)
* Thanks, to the self tapping screws change, no more glueing of any part..)
* I made the foot bigger on the inside, and the wrist smaller (no noticeable from outside, but will have better elasticity)
* I changed the servo horn links to the ones that come with the servos PDI-HV5523MG
* I also made a tester for those servo horns so anyone can check if they would fit before printing a leg section
