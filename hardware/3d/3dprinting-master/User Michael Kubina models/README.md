# User Michael Kubina models

This modification is optimized for support-free 3D-printing, resulting in the least post-processing needed. All parts are screwed into place, no glueing necessary. You can download the FreeCAD-Files as well and modify them to your needs - or you can choose from a variety of template-files for commonly modded parts.

**Be aware, that this is a redesign from scratch, with different dimensions than the original model. It's best to print all the parts or just take the legs if you like, as these are interchangable.**

## SpotMicroESP32

These modified 3D-Parts are part of the SpotMicroESP32 project, which wants to utilize the ESP32 for the low-level control and outsource the heavy computation to external devices - either via WiFi or BLE. This is still a WIP with a lot of open tasks and in essence an educational project.

You can find great code for the inverse kinematics and an app for the control of the robot via BLE in Maarten Weyns repo already:
